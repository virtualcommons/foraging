        <h3>Facilitator Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Welcome to the facilitator interface.  This interface allows you to control
            the experiment.  You may only modify configuration parameters <b>before</b>
            you start the experiment by selecting the Configuration menu.  When all the
            participants are ready to begin the experiment, you can start the experiment
            by selecting Experiment -&gt; Start.  After a round has been completed you
            will be able to view the statistics for all of the participants.  You can
            begin the next round by selecting Round -&gt; Start.

            Welcome to the experiment. The experiment will begin shortly after everyone has been
            assigned a station.
            <br><br>
            Please <b>wait quietly</b> and <b>do not close this window, open any other applications, or communicate with any of the other participants</b>.

<h1>General Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will appear on the screen as a yellow circle <img width='23' height='23' src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/yellow-circle.png"></img>. 
You can move by pressing the four arrow keys on your keyboard.  
</p>
<p>
    You can move up, down, left, or right.  You have to press a key for each and every move of your yellow dot.  As you
    move around you can collect tokens <img width='40' height='40' src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/green-diamond.png"></img>
    and earn two cents for each collected token.  To collect a token, move your avatar over a token and <b>press the
    space bar</b>.  Simply moving your avatar over a token does NOT collect that token.
</p>

<h2>Tokens</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The tokens that you collect have the potential to regenerate.  After you have
collected a green token, a new token can re-appear on that empty cell. The rate at
which new tokens appear depends on the number of adjacent cells with tokens.
The more tokens in the eight cells that surround an empty cell, the faster a new
token will appear on that empty cell.  In other words, <b>existing tokens can
generate new tokens</b>.  To illustrate this, please refer to Image 1 and Image 2.
The middle cell in Image 1 denoted with an X has a greater chance of regeneration
than the middle cell in Image 2.  When all neighboring cells are empty, there is
<b>no chance for regeneration</b>.
</p>
<table width="100%">
<tr>
<td align="center"><b>Image 1</b></td>
<td align="center"><b>Image 2</b></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td align="center">
    <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/8neighbors.jpg" alt="image 1">
</td>
<td align="center">
    <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/5neighbors.jpg" alt="image 2">
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2>Best Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
The chance that a token will regenerate on an empty cell increases as there are
more tokens surrounding it.  Therefore, you want to have as many tokens around an
empty cell as possible.  However, you also need empty cells to benefit from this
regrowth. The best arrangement of tokens that maximizes overall regrowth is the
checkerboard diagram shown below.

<h2>Practice Round</h2>
<hr>
<p>
We will soon begin a practice round, where you will have {duration} to practice with the experimental environment. The
decisions you make in this round will NOT influence your earnings.

<p>
You can chat with the other participants in your group during this round.
You may discuss any aspect of the experiment with the other participants in your group with two exceptions:
<ol>
    <li>You <b>may not promise side-payments after the experiment is completed or threaten anyone with any consequence after the experiment is finished</b>.</li>
    <li>You <b>may not reveal your actual identity</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If we detect any violation of the
rules we will have to stop the experiment and remove the offending group from the
room.
</p>
<p>
    You will see other participants labeled from A to {self.lastChatHandle} in the chat
    window.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield and pressing
    the enter key.

<p>
This was the last round, but not the end of the experiment. We ask that you please carefully fill out a brief survey as we prepare your payments.

<h2>Payment</h2>
<hr>
<p>
When payments are ready we will call you up one by one. Please wait until your
computer number, <b>{clientData.id}</b>, is called to turn in your survey and
receive payment.  Please answer the survey carefully and thank you for
participating. 
</p>
<p>
NOTE: Please <b>answer the survey completely (there may be a back side)</b>
and <b>bring all your belongings with you</b> when you come up to
receive your payment to help us speed up the payment process.
