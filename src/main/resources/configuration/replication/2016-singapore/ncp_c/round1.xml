        <h1>Instructions for Rounds 1-{self.repeat}</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The length of each of the following {self.repeat} rounds is {self.duration} seconds. As in the practice
            round you can collect green tokens but there are two important differences. You will earn
            <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for each token collected and you <b>cannot reset</b> the distribution of
            green tokens. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In this round the renewable resource will become five times bigger. You
            will share this larger environment with other players in this room.
            Each of you has been randomly assigned to one of several equal-sized
            {self.clientsPerGroup}-person groups.  Each of the groups is collecting tokens from an identical, but
            separate resource. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Each of you has been assigned a number from 1 to {self.clientsPerGroup}.  The other members of your
            group will appear on the screen as blue circles <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/blue-circle.png"> with a
            white number in the middle of the circle.  On the top right corner of the screen you can see how many tokens
            each player has collected.
        </p>
        <h3>Anonymity</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            Because group membership was randomly assigned by the computer, neither you nor
            the experimenter will be able to identify which person in the room has been
            assigned to a particular group or number within a group.  Your anonymity is
            guaranteed.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>
