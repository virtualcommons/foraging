        <h3>Instructions for the Next {self.repeat} Rounds</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>
            The next {self.repeat} rounds are the same as the previous rounds with two exceptions - you will not be able
            to anonymously communicate with the other participants in your group and you will also not be able to remove
            tokens from other players.
        </p>
        <p>
            The length of this round is again {duration}.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have any questions please raise your hand.  <b>Do you have any questions so far?</b>
