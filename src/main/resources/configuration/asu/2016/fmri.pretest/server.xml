    This facilitator interface allows you to control the experiment.  In general you
    will be following a sequence similar to this:
    <ol>
        <li>Show instructions</li>
        <li>Start round</li>
        <li>After round is over
            <ol>
                <li>show trust game if necessary</li>
                <li>start standalone chat round if necessary</li>
            </ol>
        </li>

<h1>General Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
You will appear on the screen as a yellow circle <img width='25' height='25' src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/yellow-circle.png"></img>. 
You can move by pressing either the four arrow keys or W, S, A, D, or I, K, J, L on your keyboard to move up,
down, left, or right respectively.  You must press a key for each and every move. As you move around you can collect tokens 
<img width='25' height='25' src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/green-diamond.png"></img> and earn <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> for
each collected token.  To collect a token, move your avatar over it and <b>press the space bar</b>.  Simply moving your
avatar over a token does <b>not collect</b> that token.

<h1>Instructions</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    You will now participate in an exercise where you will be matched with a random
    person in your group. In this exercise there are two roles, Player 1 and Player 2.
    Your job is to design strategies for both Player 1 and Player 2 roles.  When you
    are randomly paired with another member of your group you may be selected as
    Player 1 <b>or</b> Player 2.  The results of randomly pairing your strategies
    with the other group member's strategies will be shown to you at the <b>end of
    the experiment</b>.
</p>

<h2>How to participate</h2>
<hr>
<ol>
    <li>Player 1 will first receive an endowment of one dollar and has to decide <b>how much to keep</b>.  The remaining amount is <b>sent to Player 2</b>.
    <li>The amount Player 1 sends to Player 2 is tripled by the system and then
        given to Player 2.  Player 2 must then decide <b>how much to keep</b> and <b>how much to send back to Player 1</b>.
</ol>
<p>
For example, if Player 1 sends 0 cents to Player 2, Player 1 earns 1 dollar and
Player 2 earns 0 cents. However, if Player 1 sends 1 dollar to Player 2, 3 dollars
would be sent to Player 2.  Player 2 then decides to return $1.75 back to Player 1.
In this case, Player 1 earns $1.75, and Player 2 earns $1.25.
</p>
<p>
Please fill in the following form to design your strategies as Player 1 or Player 2.
<br>
<b>If you have any questions, please raise your hand.  Are there any questions?</b>

<![CDATA[
<p>
You can chat with the other participants in your group during this round.
You may discuss any aspect of the experiment with the other participants in your group with two exceptions:
<ol>
    <li>You <b>may not promise side-payments after the experiment is completed or threaten anyone with any consequence after the experiment is finished</b>.</li>
    <li>You <b>may not reveal your actual identity</b></li>
</ol>
<p>
We are monitoring the chat traffic while you chat. If we detect any violation of the
rules we will have to stop the experiment and remove the offending group from the
room.
</p>
<p>
    You will see other participants labeled from A to {self.lastChatHandle} in the chat
    window.  You can send a chat message by typing into the textfield and pressing
    the enter key.
