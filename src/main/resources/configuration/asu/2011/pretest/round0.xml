<h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will now have four minutes to practice with the experimental environment. The
decisions you make in this round will NOT influence your earnings.  At the beginning
of the practice round a quarter of the cells are occupied with green tokens.  The
environment is a {resourceWidth} x {resourceDepth} grid of cells.
</p>
<p>
During this practice round, and <b>only during</b> this practice round, you are able
to reset the tokens displayed on the screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you
press the <b>R</b> key you will reset the resource to its initial distribution,
randomly filling a quarter of the cells.
</p>
<p>If you have any questions please raise your hand. <b>Do you have any questions so far?</b></p>

        In this question, "A", "B", and "D" are all true.  "C" is false.  Tokens only
        regenerate when there are other tokens present in their immediately neighboring
        cells. They do not spontaneously generate from the middle of the screen.
