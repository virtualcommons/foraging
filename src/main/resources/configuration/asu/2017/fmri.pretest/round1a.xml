<h1>Instructions for Stage {self.roundIndexLabel}</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    The length of each of the following {self.repeat} rounds in this
    stage is {self.duration} seconds. As in the practice round you
    can collect green tokens. However, this time you will earn
    <b>{dollarsPerToken}</b> lab dollars for each token 
    collected. You <b>cannot</b> reset the distribution of green  
    tokens.   
</p>
<p>
    On the top right corner of the screen you can see how many tokens
    you have collected. On the top left corner of the 
    screen you can see the amount of time remaining in the round.
</p>
<p><b>If you have any questions please raise your hand.</b></p>

<h1>Changes to the Experimental Environment</h1>
<hr>
<p>
    We will now make a change to the environment, namely the regeneration of tokens. New tokens can now reappear in
    empty cells. The rate at which new tokens appear depends on the number of adjacent cells with tokens. The more
    tokens in the eight cells that surround an empty cell, the faster a new token will appear on that empty cell. In
    other words, <b>existing tokens can generate new tokens</b>. To illustrate this, please refer to Image 1 and Image
    2. The middle cell in Image 1 denoted with an X has a greater chance of regeneration than the middle cell in Image
    2.  When all neighboring cells are empty, there is <b>no chance for regeneration</b>.

<h2>Best Strategy</h2>
<hr>
<p>
    The chance that a token will regenerate on an empty cell increases as there are
    more tokens surrounding it.  The best arrangement of tokens that maximizes overall regrowth is the checkerboard
    diagram shown below.

            You have answered all the questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b> in lab dollars.
            {else}
            You answered {numberCorrect} out of {totalQuestions} questions correctly and earned <b>{totalQuizEarnings}</b> in lab dollars.  Questions you've answered

<form>
<span class='q1'>Q1. Tokens grow from the middle of the screen.</span> <br>
    <b>{incorrect_q1}
        This statement is false. Tokens only regenerate when there are other tokens present in their immediately
        neighboring cells. They do not spontaneously generate from the middle of the screen.
    </b>
<br><br>
<span class='q2'>Q2. In order to collect a token you need to press the space bar while your avatar is on a cell with a token.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q2} 
        This statement is true. You must press the space bar when your avatar is on a cell with a token to collect that token.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q3'>Q3. When you have collected all tokens on the screen, no new tokens will appear.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q3} 
        This statement is true. Tokens can only regenerate if there are other tokens present in their immediately neighboring cells.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q4'>Q4. Your decisions of where to collect tokens affects the regeneration of tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q4} 
        This statement is true. The chance that a new token will appear in an empty cell is greatest when the eight cells surrounding that
        empty cell all have tokens. 
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q5'>Q5. Is the following sequence possible?</span>
<img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q5.png" /> 
<br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q5} 
        Yes, this sequence is possible. New tokens can regenerate on an empty cell when neighboring cells have existing tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q6'>Q6. Is the following sequence possible?</span><img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/q6.png" /> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q6} 
        No, this sequence is not possible. New tokens cannot regenerate on an empty cell when all neighboring cells are also empty.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q7'>Q7. If each token is worth $0.02 and you collect 100 tokens in a round, you have earned 3 dollars in that round.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q7} 
        This statement is false. You would have earned 100 * $0.02 = $2.00 in that round.
    </b>
    <br><br>
            <span class='q8'>Q8. The duration of a round is {self.duration} seconds.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q8} 
        This statement is true. The round will last {self.duration} seconds.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q9'>Q9. All the cells are filled with green tokens at the start of the experiment.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q9} 
        This statement is false. At the beginning of each round, 25% of the cells will be filled with green tokens.
    </b>
    <br><br>
<span class='q10'>Q10. The amount of tokens you can earn only depends on how fast you collect the tokens.</span> <br>
    <b>
        {incorrect_q10} 
        This statement is false. The amount of tokens you can earn depends on how you manage your tokens, not how fast you collect them.
