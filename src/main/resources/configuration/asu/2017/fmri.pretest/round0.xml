<h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
<hr>
<p>
You will now have {self.duration} seconds to practice with the
experimental environment. The decisions you make in this round will
<b>not affect your earnings</b>. At the beginning of the practice
round {initialDistribution} of the cells are occupied with green
tokens.  The environment is a {self.resourceWidth} x
{self.resourceDepth} grid of cells.
</p>

During this practice round, and <b>only during this practice
round</b>, you will be able to reset the tokens displayed on the
screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you press the <b>R</b> key
you will reset the distribution of the tokens to once again randomly
