        <h2>Practice Round Instructions</h2>
        <hr>
        <p> Once everyone has finished the quiz, we will start a practice round of the token task. </p>
        <p>
            During the practice round, you will have {duration} to practice with the experimental environment. The
            decisions you make in this round will NOT influence your earnings.  At the beginning of the practice round
            {initialDistribution} of the cells are occupied with green tokens.  The environment is a
            {self.resourceWidth} x {self.resourceDepth} grid of cells. 
        </p>
        <p> During this practice round, and <b>only during</b> this practice round, you are able to reset the tokens
            displayed on the screen by pressing the <b>R</b> key.  When you press the <b>R</b> key you will reset the
            distribution of the tokens to randomly occupying {initialDistribution} of the cells with tokens. 
        </p>
        <p><b>Do you have any questions?</b> If you have any questions at this time please raise your hand and someone will come over to your station and answer it.</p>

        In this question, "A", "B", and "D" are all true.  "C" is false.  Tokens only
        regenerate when there are other tokens present in their immediately neighboring
        cells. They do not spontaneously generate from the middle of the screen.

C. Tokens grow from the middle of the screen.<br>
D. To collect a token you need to press the space bar while your yellow dot <img src="@CODEBASE_URL@/images/gem-self.gif"></img> is on a cell with a token.<br>

        {incorrect_q2} 
        In this question, sequence "B" is not possible.  Tokens cannot regenerate on an empty screen as shown in sequence B.
